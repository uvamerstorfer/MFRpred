# MCpred
Trying to predict the magnetic field within an ICME at Earth (L1) with (1) machine learning algorithms, and (2) analogue ensemble method. 

If you clone the repository, it should work as it is. Important is the file and directory structure, since this structure is implemented in a static way, with paths directly coded in the Python scripts. 

# (1) Machine learning 
# Brief instruction for running the scripts
